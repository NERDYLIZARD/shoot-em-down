# Shoot 'Em Down 
A 2D Shoot 'Em Up game (STG) developed with Java and its native library.

A player must shoot all enemies down within the time-bound, or they will keep respawning which makes a stage harder to defeat. Each enemy's death may drop any of three special runes: First, the "Power Rune" - a collection of which widens the firing angle of the player. Second, the "Slow Down Rune" that gives the player a special ability to slow down the movement of all enemies. Third, the "Life Rune" that increases the player's health point.
